            Over the past years I have given dozens of different answers to the question of why Marilyn Monroe continues to appeal to me 
            and the reaosns will continue to eveolve as time passes. I was in 5th grade when I first 'discovered' Marilyn, I admired how she was a rebel, how she was someone who went against
            the grain in an era where women were pressured and told where their place was and not to have an opion. Knowing how she fought 
            so hard to better her life was both encouraging and inspiring. Raised an oprphan, she did not let her upbringing 
            put a stop to any dreams she may have had. In fact, if anything it made her all the more determined. Now that I am 
            a older, I can appreciate how marilyn was trying to push boundries and chnage the world. She fought not only for her own rights, but 
            for others too. Marilyn's star contunies to shine no matter how many years have past.
            Here's an Ode to Marilyn Monroe :
